# CanvasSync

Welcome to CanvasSync, your slightly overenthusiastic digital organizer. It downloads your Canvas course materials so you don't have to!

## Setup

1. **Get the Code**: Clone or download this repo: `git clone https://github.com/arnav-ag/CanvasSync.git`.  
2. **Install the Magic**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Run Setup**: Execute `python CanvasSync.py setup` and answer a few easy questions.
4. **Relax**: CanvasSync syncs every 2 hours. You'll barely notice it's there (until you need it).

## Features

- Automatically downloads files from Canvas.
- Runs in the background.
- Might make you feel like a tech wizard (no guarantees).

## Disclaimer

Not responsible for:
- Your newfound organizational pride.
- The sudden urge to color-code everything.

Note that the main branch is using multi-threading while the async branch uses asyncio. Performance is generally similar so choose what you like ðŸ˜©  

Happy Syncing! ðŸŽ“ðŸ’¾
